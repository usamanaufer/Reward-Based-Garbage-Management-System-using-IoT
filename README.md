# Reward Garbage Management System using IoT

Many people are unaware of or underestimate the environmental consequences of littering. When a person sees litter piled up in one location, it conveys the idea that littering there is acceptable and also People has been throwing garbage out of their kitchen windows or balconies, because they are too lazy to dispose of it properly. People have also become so careless that they toss trash wherever without even thinking about it.

## Project Scope

Given Sri Lanka's waste management challenges. The projects aim is to build a system which provides points for users for disposing the garbage on trash bins properly and this can be achieved by using Ultra sonic sensors. The user can scan the garbage bin unique code using a QR code scanner with the mobile app and gain points for the disposal and the gained points can be claimed later for discounts in selected outlets.

The main objectives of this project are,

- To detect the garbage disposal and provide points to the right unique person respectively.
- To provide better waste management system using less costs.
- Integrate these systems with mobile applications
- Develop a cross platform mobile application.

The app will provide features to view the total balanced points, used points and the points transaction and more other features similar to this with connection of cloud and IoT devices for the data required.
